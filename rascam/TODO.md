# API ideas

## New SimpleCamera

Note that these C types should actually be wrappers, not raw types or they are likely to cause memory management fun.

There should be settings for brightness, exposure, burst mode, image format etc etc.

Should we provide a preview API?

What API should be used for getting camera info? Note that this lists both cameras and "flashes".

### `SimpleCamera::new() -> SimpleCamera`

### `set_camera_num(u8) -> Result<MMAL_PARAMETER_CAMERA_INFO_CAMERA_T, MMAL_STATUS_T>`

### `set_camera_info(MMAL_PARAMETER_CAMERA_INFO_CAMERA_T) -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

This is a companion for the above. Useful if the user already has a `MMAL_PARAMETER_CAMERA_INFO_CAMERA_T`. Does it provide enough value?

### `activate() -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

Start the camera. Useful for metering etc.

### `capture_still() -> Future<[u8], MMAL_STATUS_T>`

Take a still picture.

What about burst mode? `capture_burst() -> Stream<[u8], MMAL_STATUS_T>`?

### `record_video() -> Stream<[u8], MMAL_STATUS_T>`

Record a video and return a stream of frames.

### `stop_video()`

Should this return a `Result<(), ?>` so that we can error if not already recording a video?

## Old SimpleCamera

Is there much need for `Result` when we have `MMAL_SUCCESS`? Not really but `Result` is Rust-like and `MMAL_SUCCESS` is C-like.

How should we represent errors? Is just `MMAL_STATUS_T` ok?
Is this informative? Should we have a `CameraError` type with a code property? Is this better? Is it enough?

What happens when there are multiple libmmal calls inside a method? Is it clear which the error comes from or what it means?

### `SimpleCamera::new() -> Result<SimpleCamera, MMAL_STATUS_T>`

Should this actually create camera objects? (it does now)  
Should this take the camera number?  
Should this take a `MMAL_PARAMETER_CAMERA_INFO_CAMERA_T`?

### `set_camera_num(u8) -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

If constructor doesn't take a camera number or camera info, we
should get one here.

Users or SimpleCamera shouldn't care about any of the following APIs except `take()`.

### `create_encoder() -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

### `enable_control_port() -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

### `set_camera_params(MMAL_PARAMETER_CAMERA_INFO_CAMERA_T) -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

Users shouldn't have to pass this in.

### `set_camera_format(MMAL_PARAMETER_CAMERA_INFO_CAMERA_T) -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

Users shouldn't have to pass this in and certainly not twice.

### `enable() -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

### `create_pool() -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

### `create_preview() -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

### `enable_preview() -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

### `connect_ports() -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

### `enable_still_port() -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

### `take() -> Result<(), MMAL_STATUS_T>`

Rename to capture?

## SeriousCamera (or just Camera?)

## CameraInfo

`CameraInfo::info() -> Result<CameraInfo, MMAL_STATUS_T>`

Note that `mmal_port_parameter_get` and `mmal_port_parameter_set` use memcpy into our struct so `params` should be owned by rust.
